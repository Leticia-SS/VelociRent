## 1. Introduction

### General Description
VelociRent is a project designed to implement a bicycle rental system within an academic environment. It integrates with the college's enrollment system and leverages the functionalities of the Wheels platform. The main goal is to offer a sustainable transportation option for actively enrolled students, improving mobility between their homes and the institution. The platform will be accessible via a web interface and messaging apps like Telegram. The system will be managed by the institution, with student involvement in specific roles.

### Project Objective
The main objective is to provide students with a sustainable and efficient means of transportation, fully integrated with the college's enrollment system. VelociRent will ensure access control based on enrollment status, create internship opportunities in maintenance and management, and allow entrepreneurial students to offer their own bicycles for rent. The system aims for efficiency, security, and autonomy for both the institution and users.
